- 👋 Hi, I’m @koenigsarah1. I'm an assistant professor of history at Ramapo College of New Jersey.
- 👀 I’m interested in applying digital technologies to my research and teaching, which are in the fields of Native American history, religion, and the American West. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Markdown. I'm a total beginner, so expect this hub to be messy! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on syllabus design and Python for text analysis. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at skoenig1@ramapo.edu
